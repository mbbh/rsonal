Rsonal - minimal fast JSON writer

Rsonal is a very minimalistic, straight-forward JSON writer.
It is designed to receive an arbirary ruby object and will
attempt to turn it into JSON.

There is, right now, no JSON parsing support, this library is
write only. The generated JSON is compilant to the JSON
specification on json.org. The generated json string does
not support any form of pretty printing and the code is
optimised more for speed then for readability.


There are no external dependencies besides the ruby library.
Tested with ruby 2.1.2.
